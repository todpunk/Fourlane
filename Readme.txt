Fourlane is a Java bot built on the PIRCbot library, and includes a jar of that project to prevent versioning problems.

The goal is to make the bot as basic as possible and yet provide any functionality someone would want through plugins that are easy to right and maintain.  

Note that no precautions are taken to prevent plugins from running amok, so be careful what plugins you install, but installing should be as easy as dropping the plugin into the plugins directory and loading it into the bot.

For support, we prefer you contact the community at irc://irc.esper.net/#todandlorna and ask in-channel, though TodPunk will likely be the one to answer whenever he's on.
